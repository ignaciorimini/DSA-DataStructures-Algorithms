# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C language

## Table of Contents
1. Linked Lists: Linked lists are a fundamental data structure where elements are connected using pointers.
2. Stacks: Stacks are a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are inserted and removed from the same end.
3. Queues: Queues are a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.
4. Binary Trees: Binary trees are hierarchical data structures where each node has at most two children.
5. Heaps: Heaps are binary trees that satisfy the heap property, making them useful for priority queues and sorting algorithms.
6. Hash Tables: Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to array indices, enabling efficient data retrieval.

Each data structure is implemented in C and comes with detailed explanations and usage examples. These programs serve as a valuable resource for anyone learning data structures and their applications in C programming.
Please refer to each individual folder for more details on each data structure implementation. Happy coding!

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the desired data structure folder.
Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
Run the executable to see the data structure in action.
Enjoy exploring and experimenting with data structures in C!
